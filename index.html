        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><section id="first"><h2 id="dishname1">Masala dosa</h2>
        <p class="discription1">A crispy, rice-batter crepe encases a spicy mix of mashed 
            potato, which is then dipped in coconut chutney, pickles,
             tomato-and-lentil-based sauces and other condiments. It's
              a fantastic breakfast food that'll keep you going till 
              lunch, when you'll probably come back for another.</p></section></div> 
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><section id="second"><h2 id="dishname2">Paella</h2>
        <p class="discription2">The sea is lapping just by your feet, a warm breeze whips the 
            tablecloth around your legs and a steamy pan of paella sits in 
            front of you. Shrimp, lobster, mussels and cuttlefish combine 
            with white rice and various herbs, oil and salt in this Valencian
             dish to send you immediately into holiday mode.  </p></section></div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><section id="third"><h2 id="dishname3">Chicken rice</h2>
        <p class="discription3">Often called the "national dish" of Singapore, this steamed or 
            boiled chicken is served atop fragrant oily rice, with sliced 
            cucumber as the token vegetable. Variants include roasted chicken 
            or soy sauce chicken. However it's prepared, it's one of Singapore's
            best foods. </p></section></div>
